<p>I’m a 18 french student, currently learning computer engineering, who loves making custom content for Games.</p>

<p>I started by making animations and posters with SFM for TF2 in 2014. I really enjoyed it, and even wrote some guides on it. But I lost interest when I stopped playing TF2.
In 2015, I started making maps for Portal 2, it was awesome, but I found myself limited by the in-game editor. This is where I discovered Hammer World Editor. It was very difficult at first, and I only made a small map with it. Playing CS:GO, I also made a small map for it.
During the same year, I also decided to try Unity 3D and made some games with it.</p>

<p>Then came 2016 summer holidays, I found out about the CS:GO’s Hide and Seek gamemode, and I decided to remake official maps for it. It got way more success than I expected: The first map got as much downloads in one day than what my first CS:GO map got in one year!
I continued making maps and games, and found myself limited in changing how the game works with Hammer. I then tried Sourcemod, and made some plugins for CS:GO with it.</p>
