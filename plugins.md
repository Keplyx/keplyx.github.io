# Plugins

Here is a list of all my public plugins made for CS:GO, available to download for free. All of them are under GPLv3 licence, meaning you can read/modify them as long as you agree to the terms of the licence.

When available, prefer the github link instead of the alliedmodders one as plugins on github are updated more often.
