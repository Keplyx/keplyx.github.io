# Welcome


This website hosts most of my work in video-games, from modding to game-making!

I'm doing this for fun, and all of my work is available for free, and most of it is Open-Source, meaning you can look up the code.

I made maps for the source engine (Portal 2 and CS:GO), plugins for CS:GO, a software for map-making, and some little games to learn game developement.
