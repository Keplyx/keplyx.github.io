# Softwares

### Memorisia

Android application focused on taking notes for homeworks.

Like most of my work here, it is available on [Github](https://github.com/Keplyx/Memorisia) under the GPLv3 license.

### CSGO map renamer

[Available on Github](https://github.com/Keplyx/Source-Map-Renamer)

This software helps mappers in renaming their maps and all necessary files.

It was a small project I made to learn Java.
