# About

I'm a 18 French student, currently learning computer science, who loves making custom content for games.

I started by making animations and posters with SFM for TF2 in 2014. I really enjoyed it, and even wrote some guides about it.
In 2015, I started making maps for Portal 2, but found myself limited by the in-game editor. This is where I discovered Hammer World Editor. It was very difficult at first, and I only made some small maps for portal and csgo with it.
During the same year, I also decided to try Unity 3D to see how game development worked.

Then came 2016 summer holidays, I found out about the CS:GO's Hide and Seek gamemode, and decided to remake official maps for it. It got way more success than I expected: The first map got as much downloads in one day than what my first CS:GO map got in one year!
I continued making maps and games, then tried Sourcemod, and made some plugins for CS:GO with it.

Now I do not make poster/animations or maps anymore, but sometimes work on plugins for csgo when I have free time.
